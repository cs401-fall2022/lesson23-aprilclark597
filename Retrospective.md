## Experience
- Were there any things that you struggled with?
  - Yeah connecting the database proved to be quite difficult for me. I spent a lot of time trying to get the configurations correct.
  I tried using MySQL since I am mode familiar with it but ultimately switched the SQLite since that was was recommended. 


- Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified?
  - I referred back to lab 10 instructions for the Express and Database details
- Were you able to get the entire project done?
  - Right now my database is not successfully connected, but I think I', close
